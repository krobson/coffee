# What I wish someone had told me when I began my coffee journey...

The following sections share what I wish someone has told me when I started to get interested in coffee.

## Where to start

Many people start with espresso.  I would not recommend this, instead start with learning to make V60s, for the following reasons:
* A decent espresso machine is really expensive, progressing through machines as you discover how they limit your skills is even more expensive
* A basic set-up, see below for one, to make a V60 is relatively inexpensive
* You can make a good V60 fairly quickly, learning to make a good espresso is much harder in my opinion
* What you learn perfecting a good V60 provides a good foundation for espresso if you later go in that direction

## A basic set-up

Following is a basic setup for making your first V60
* Required
  * The best grinder you can possibly afford, that does both grinds for pour-overs and grinds for espresso in case you go in that direction later (required)
  * The best scales you can possibly afford, meaning they are at least 0.1 gram accurate, and they weigh as fast as possible (request)
  * A Hario 02 V60 dripper made from plastic which requires less pre-heating than the glass, metal, or china ones (required)
  * Some CAFEC V60 02 1-4 cup abaca white filter papers (required)
  * A 4:6 app for your phone (required)
  * Hario karafe
* Optional
  * A Hario drip assist (optional but heavily recommended, particularly if you do not have a temperature-controlled pouring kettle)
  * A temperature-controlled pouring kettle (optional)
  * Excellent medium-roasted coffee beans that were roasted about a week ago (required)
